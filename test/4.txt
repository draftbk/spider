　　五、报告摘要
　　The Euro crisis: Is there any escape? The countries of the Eurozone have experienced their very own form of financial crisis. Why have the problems in the Eurozone been so protracted and so difficult to resolve?  It seems that the fundamental dilemmas built into the Eurozone at the very start have come back to haunt today’s policy makers. Will the UK’s move to exit the EU add some extra difficulties? Can the Eurozone escape its troubles? All ways out seem to involve compromise that some of the parties are unwilling to make. What are the chances the Eurozone will collapse?
