　　五、报告摘要
　　This paper studies the model identification problem of k-double auctions between one buyer and one seller when the transaction price, rather than the traders’ bids, can be observed. Given that only the price data is available, I explore an identification strategy that utilizes the double auctions with extreme pricing weight (k = 1 or 0) and exclusive covariates that shift only one trader’s value distribution to identify both the buyer’s and the seller’s value distributions nonparametrically. First, as each exclusive covariate can take at least two values, the buyer’s and the seller’s value distributions are partially identified from the price distribution for k = 1 or k = 0. The identified set is sharp and can be easily computed. I provide a set of sufficient conditions under which the traders’ value distributions are point identified. Second, when the exclusive covariates are continuous, it is shown that the buyer’s and the seller’s value distributions will be uniquely determined by a partial differential equation that only depends on the price distribution, provided that the value distributions are known for at least one value of the exclusive covariates.
